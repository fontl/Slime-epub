<h3>Prologue - Death and Reincarnation</h3>
<br />
<p>A life so normal that nothing can be said about it.</p>
<p>After leaving college, I joined a major general contractor firm and am living alone now at the age of 37. Having no girlfriend.</p>
<p>Filial duty left to my older brother, my life is essentially that of an independent, single noble.</p>
<p>Neither short of height, or wanting of a good face. Yet unpopular. I have tried exherting effort into finding a girlfriend – and have confessed thrice! – but after being dumped, my heart is left shattered. Well, having reached this age, I can honestly say that this romance thing is naught but troublesome.</p>
<p>And although you could say that I am mostly busy with work, it’s not like I am troubled by not having one. It’s not like I am making excuses… really.</p>
<p>「Senpai! Sorry for keeping you waiting!」</p>
<p>With a cheerful smile the young man approaches me. And, by his side–a beauty.</p>
<p>More specifically, the young man, Tamura, is a junior at the same company I work at; the one by his side is our company’s renowned Madonna, the receptionist Sawatari-san.</p>
<p>Yep, I have been asked by these guys to offer consultation on their upcoming marriage. And by the way, this is the reason why I started wondering about my own unpopularity.</p>
<p>The after-work rendezvous was held at an intersection, and there the two hoped to indulge my thoughtfulness and support.</p>
<p>「Yeah. So, what kind of advice are you looking for?」</p>
<p>I ask while greeting Sawatari-san.</p>
<p>「Hello, pleased to meet you.My name is Sawatari Miho. Although we have seen each other before, this would be the first time we are speaking, right? Makes me nervous, somehow. 」</p>
<p>The nervous one is me, damn it! I mean, I am not that good with speaking to girls in the first place. Cut me some slack! With such words, I silently complain to myself.</p>
<p>And in the first place, with no apparent love experience, what kind of advice can I even offer? Aren’t you all just poking fun at me! It’s spite, isn’t it.</p>
<p>「Hello. I am Mikami Satoru. No need to be nervous or anything. Sawatari-san is famous with us, so I know who you are even without the introduction. About Tamura–we went to the same University, you know, so we’ve had lots to talk about. After which we naturally hung out a bit.」</p>
<p>「What’s this about being famous? Are there weird rumors floating about?」</p>
<p>「Yeah. Like having had an affair with Chief X, or going on dates with Y-kun–things like that.」</p>
<p>It was all just teasing, of course. And although I intended these to be just some light jokes, Sawatari-san’s face turned bright red and she looked at me with watery eyes. Hate to admit it, but she looked adorable.</p>
<p>Well, my jokes lack both delicacy or tact, and I am often told to keep my mouth shut… but I end up saying them anyways.</p>
<p>Yep, failed again, huh? Yep, I am just bad with women.</p>
<p>And as if on cue, in steps Tamura, lightly tapping her shoulders.</p>
<p>Damn it, Tamura you bastard! It’s these situations where you <em>riajuu</em> should just all explode! I should shout this, right?</p>
<p>「Senpai, please leave it at that! And, Miho, you are just being teased!」</p>
<p>With a laugh Tamura continues mediating the situation. Aren’t you dandy, junior!</p>
<p>Bright, cheerful, and without a hint of sarcasm. Isn’t he a lovable guy…</p>
<p>Tamura’s only 28. And although we are so many years apart, we’ve got something in common. Well, nothing to do I guess but to give them my blessing…</p>
<p>「My bad. I’m just not that good with women. And, well, the location doesn’t help much, does it? Let’s get something to eat and talk there.」</p>
<p>It’s just jealousy, after all. And just when I thought so…</p>
<p>「「「Kyaaaaaaaaaa!」」」</p>
<p>Screams. Confusion.</p>
<p>What? What’s going on?</p>
<p>「Move it! I’ll kill you!」</p>
<p>Turning to the sound of the voice, a man brandishing a knife and holding a bag is running towards us.</p>
<p>I hear the scream. I see the man. I see the knife. Where is it pointing? At….</p>
<p>「Tamuraaa!」</p>
<p>*Don* I hit Tamura out of the way.</p>
<p>*Dosu* There’s a burning pain in my back.</p>
<p>「Tch, damn hindrance!」</p>
<p>Having shouted thus, I see the man escaping and turn to make sure Tamura and Sawatari-san are safe.</p>
<p>With a shout that resembled no words, Tamura runs up to me.</p>
<p>Sawatari-san is stunned by the sudden turn of events, but appears without other injury… thank god.</p>
<p>That being that, my back burns. Feelings of pain aside, it just burns.</p>
<p>What’s up with this? It’s too hot… can’t it let off a bit?</p>
<p>&#0171;Confirmed. Establishing heat resistance. Success&#0187;</p>
<p>Could it be… was I stabbed?</p>
<p>Can’t be dying from a stab wound….</p>
<p>&#0171;Confirmed. Establishing pierce resistance. Success. Additionally, establishing physical attack resistance. Success&#0187;</p>
<p>「Senpai… there’s blood coming out… it’s not stopping… it’s ain’t…」</p>
<p>What’s up with this loud guy. Feel like his voice was strange just now; well, that much can be expected from Tamura.</p>
<p>But blood? Yeah, that’s clearly leaving. I am human, after all. When stabbed, I bleed!</p>
<p>But pain is unpleasant, isn’t it….</p>
<p>&#0171;Confirmed. Removing perception of pain. Success&#0187;</p>
<p>Well… this is bad, right? Pain and impatience are muddling my senses.</p>
<p>「Ta… Tamura… you are damn loud. It… is not that big of deal, right? Stop worrying…」</p>
<p>「Senpai… the blood… you keep…」</p>
<p>His face blue, on the verge of tears, Tamura continues to hold me. That’s the face that is the ruin of handsome men.</p>
<p>I tried to take a look at how Sawatari-san was doing, but my vision is too hazy. Can’t see.</p>
<p>The burning sensation in my back is gone. Instead, a ferocious cold strikes me.</p>
<p>This could be bad… when people don’t have enough blood, they die, don’t they?</p>
<p>&#0171;Confirmed. Creating a bloodless body. Success&#0187;</p>
<p>(Hey, you, what’s this you’ve been going on about the past few minutes….)</p>
<p>I try to speak, but no words come out. This is bad, maybe I really will die….</p>
<p>But hey, I no longer feel neither pain nor the burning.</p>
<p>But it’s cold. So cold, and nothing I can do about it. What’s with this… I am too busy of a man to be freezing in this cold.</p>
<p>&#0171;Confirmed. Establishing cold resistance. Success. Additionally, heat resistance has successfully evolved into thermal fluctuation resistance EX&#0187;</p>
<p>At that time, the dying brain cells of mine, with a flash of inspiration, have remembered the truly important things!</p>
<p>Yes! The contents of my PC hard drive!</p>
<p>「Tamuraa!! If and only <em style="font-weight:inherit;">if</em>, I say, I die… take care of my PC. I beg you… submerge it in water, turn it on, and completely wipe the data clean…」</p>
<p>Thus I, having summoned the remainder of my strength, have conveyed the matters of most grave importance.</p>
<p>&#0171;Confirmed. Attempting full format of all information. Error, impossible due to lack of definition. Attempting alternate interpretation. Establishing electricity resistance. Success. Additionally, paralysis resistance has been acquired&#0187;</p>
<p>I don’t know exactly what Tamura was saying at that moment, while giving me that blank look.</p>
<p>But, I understood the meaning of what was said.</p>
<p>「Haha… that’s so like Senpai…」</p>
<p>He said with a bitter smile. Who would even want to look at a man’s crying face? That grin is so many times better.</p>
<p>「You know, I… about Sawatari, I wanted to show her off to senpai…」</p>
<p>Heh, I knew it.. .this bastard.</p>
<p>「Tch… jeez. I’ve forgiven all of it, so your girlfriend, make her happy, got it? And take care of the PC…」</p>
<p>The last of my strength, was only enough to say that much.</p>
<p>Completely unsatisfied, Mikami Satoru died.</p>
<p>And at that instant, Mikami Satoru’s “soul” linked with a spawned monster in another world.</p>
<p>Into a dimensional crack so small that no eye could see. His soul linked with a mass of demonic energy.</p>
<p>This mass was the origin of demons, and to Mikami Satoru who had linked to it, his thoughts as a base, the mass constructed a body.</p>
<p>What is normally is essentially an impossibility with an astronomically small chance of occurrence, Mikami Satoru was reborn as a monster in another world.</p>
<p>A life so normal that nothing can be said about it.</p>
<p>After leaving college, I joined a major general contractor firm and am living alone now at the age of 37. Having no girlfriend.</p>
<p>Filial duty left to my older brother, my life is essentially that of an independent, single noble.</p>
<p>Thus, a virgin.</p>
<p>Unbelievable, departing the world without ever been put to use… my ‘son’ must be crying right now.</p>
<p>Sorry, I never could make you into an adult…</p>
<p>When I am reborn, we’ll change things around. Go on the offensive with a bang. Call them out, and go on devouring spree…. But that’s no good, is it?</p>
<p>&#0171;Confirmed. Unique skill [Predator] has been acquired&#0187;</p>
<p>And well, at almost forty years old, the thirty year old virgin that I am, in a magical world would certainly be a sage… heck, a great sage wouldn’t be out of the question, would it?</p>
<p>&#0171;Confirmed. Extra skill [Sage] has been acquired. Additionally, extra skill [Sage] has successfully evolved into unique skill [Great Sage] &#0187;</p>
<p>…. the hell you’ve been on about? The hell is [Great Sage]! Are you making fun of me?</p>
<p>It isn’t even a bit unique!</p>
<p>I am not laughing here!</p>
<p>So rude..</p>
<p>Thinking that, I went to sleep.</p>
<p>(So this is death, huh… not as lonesome as I thought.)</p>
<p>Those were, for Mikami Satoru, the lost words spoken in this word.</p>
