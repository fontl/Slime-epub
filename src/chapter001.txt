<h3>Chapter 01 - Let&#8217;s see what I can do</h3>
<br />
<p>It&#8217;s dark.</p>
<p>The darkness envelopes all, preventing me from seeing any shape or figure.</p>
<p>Where am I? Besides, what had happened?</p>
<p>Wasn&#8217;t there someone making fun of me, calling me a&#8230; sage?&#8230; no, a great sage.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>With that thought, I regained consciousness.</p>
<p>My name is Mikami Satoru. A 37 year old, nice guy.</p>
<p>While saving my <em>kouhai</em> from a some street slasher, I got stabbed instead.</p>
<p>Alright~, remembered. I&#8217;m okay. No time for panic.</p>
<p>And really, could a cool guy like me even panic? Hah. That&#8217;s as likely as a grade school kid shi**ing his pants.</p>
<p>When I tried to look around, I finally noticed. I can&#8217;t open my eyes.</p>
<p>That problem aside, when I attempted to touch my head&#8230; I noticed my arms don&#8217;t respond. And even more perplexing is the fact that I cannot tell where my head is.</p>
<p>Alright, time to panic.</p>
<p><em>Oi</em>, <em>oi</em>, give me a sec here.</p>
<p>Just an hour please, let me catch my breath. They say that you should count prime numbers at a time like this, no?</p>
<p>1, 2, 3, <em>Daaaaa</em>!!!</p>
<p>Wrong! That&#8217;s not right. One is not a prime number, is it?</p>
<p>No no, who cares about that.</p>
<p>No time for this foolishness. I mean, aren&#8217;t I in trouble?</p>
<p><em>Are~</em>? Hey, what the heck happened?</p>
<p>Maybe&#8230; I mean what if it is too late to even consider panicking?</p>
<p>Gathering my thoughts, I confirmed that I am in no way in pain.</p>
<p>No pain. Feeling pretty good.</p>
<p>Neither hot nor cold. Actually, a really comfortable atmosphere they&#8217;ve got here.</p>
<p>I can relax a bit thanks to that.</p>
<p>Next, let&#8217;s check the limbs. Forget about them fingertips, I can&#8217;t even move a muscle&#8230;</p>
<p>How could that be?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not like one can lose their arms and legs from being stabbed&#8230; so what happened?</p>
<p>And still, I cannot open my eyes.</p>
<p>Without seeing anything, I am in utter darkness.</p>
<p>Dread and unease slowly creep their way into my heart.</p>
<p>Could this&#8230; be what they call a vegetative state?</p>
<p>Consciousness separated from nerve endings&#8211;immobile&#8230; is this what it is?</p>
<p>No, no, no, no! Please don&#8217;t let that be true!</p>
<p>Just when I thought I was saved&#8230; vegetative state? What could be worse? Even losing a half of my body would be preferable!</p>
<p>And yeah, both outcomes would be terrible. But to be alone in this darkness, without any senses&#8230; isn&#8217;t that just hell?</p>
<p>Having imagined the worst scenario, panic has quickly turned into despair.</p>
<p>I want to think it over.</p>
<p>They say that when people are confined in darkness, they quickly go mad. I happen to be in that state right now, and cannot even kill myself.</p>
<p>Rather than despairing, the only thing I can do is go insane, huh?</p>
<p>And then,</p>
<p>*Touch*</p>
<p>There was a sense of touch.</p>
<p>Hmm? What is&#8230;</p>
<p>All my senses were focused on feeling that sensation</p>
<p>With a horizontal stroke across my belly (?), I felt something akin to grass.</p>
<p>Focusing my entire consciousness on that area, I slowly began to make out the shape of my body. And by the way, the grass&#8217;s tip felt prickly against my body.</p>
<p>It kind of made me happy.</p>
<p>Yet, I&#8217;m still in complete darkness. And although I regained only one of the five senses, I could finally feel again.</p>
<p>Amused, I decided to try to head towards that grass.</p>
<p>*<em>Zururi</em>*</p>
<p>I could feel my body move.</p>
<p>It&#8230; moved?!</p>
<p>At that time, I was pretty certain that I was not on top of a hospital bed. Under my belly (?) I could feel some hard &#8211; rock, maybe.</p>
<p>I see&#8230; though I don&#8217;t really get it, I am not in a hospital.</p>
<p>Moreover, my eyes still can&#8217;t see.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t hear anything either, but it could be just that I&#8217;ve gone deaf.</p>
<p>Although I don&#8217;t know if i am facing it or not &#8211; I can&#8217;t feel my head, after all &#8211; I&#8217;ll head towards the grass. I&#8217;ll learn about myself through contact.</p>
<p>No scent in the air either. Could it be? Did I also lose the sense of smell?</p>
<p>And seriously, I just can&#8217;t understand the shape of my body.</p>
<p>I really don&#8217;t want to accept it, but it seems sleek, jelly like&#8211;the kind that is really famous in RPGs&#8211;the appearance of that kind of monster.</p>
<p>I have been entertaining that possibility in the back of my head for a while now.</p>
<p>No, no&#8230; there&#8217;s no way. I mean, no matter how&#8230; it just can&#8217;t be.</p>
<p>For the time being, let&#8217;s set those fears aside.</p>
<p>Thus, I decided to try the last of the five human senses that I&#8217;ve ignored up until now.</p>
<p>But&#8230; I don&#8217;t even know where my mouth is. What to do&#8230;?</p>
<p>＜＜Activate Unique Skill [Predator]? [YES]/[NO]＞＞</p>
<p>Suddenly, there was a voice in the back of my head.</p>
<p>Wha&#8230; what was that?</p>
<p>Unique skill [Predator]&#8230;?</p>
<p>And&#8230; what was that voice?</p>
<p>I thought I heard a strange voice while talking to Tamura before, but I guess I wasn&#8217;t just hearing things, huh&#8230;</p>
<p>Is someone there? Yet, somehow that doesn&#8217;t fit. More than someone being here&#8230; it&#8217;s more like words appearing in my mind.</p>
<p>The voice lacks intent; like the voice that would come from a computer, calling it synthesized would perhaps be most accurate.</p>
<p>For now&#8230; [NO!] is my response.</p>
<p>I am Japanese who can say no, after all.</p>
<p>Bringing up the words [NO] in my mind, I wait for a response. Yet it did not come. I waited for a bit, but felt no voice.</p>
<p>Seems like I won&#8217;t be getting a second question. Did I choose wrongly? Could this be a game that ends when I don&#8217;t choose [YES]?</p>
<p>I thought that it would be the same as in an RPG&#8211;the same question repeating until I chose [YES]&#8230; I guess I was wrong.</p>
<p>Asking a question and then leaving&#8230; what a rude guy.</p>
<p>Though I have to admit, hearing a voice did make me slightly happy.</p>
<p>I slightly regretted the decision.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Well, nothing can be done now.</p>
<p>I guess I&#8217;ll go back to trying to taste something.</p>
<p>I moved my body towards that piece of grass. While verifying my sense of touch, I leaned my body on the piece of grass.</p>
<p>I envelop the object with my body to confirm what it is&#8230; and I was right&#8211;it is, in fact, grass.</p>
<p>While touching the grass, the piece that was in contact with my body melted. And while I was worried that my body had melted, it seems to have been the greass only.</p>
<p>And thus, I understood that by melting the grass it was incorporated into my body.</p>
<p>It seems, the grass melted because it entered my body. In other words, rather than enveloping it, I seem to have swallowed it.</p>
<p>And by the way&#8230; it had no taste.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>This is, in other words, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not a human.</p>
<p>That is, I seem to have died from that stab wound, right?</p>
<p>And that was not a question, I am completely certain of this fact. And thus, rather than a hospital bed, I can confidently say that I am at some rocky place where grass grows.</p>
<p>What happened to Tamura?</p>
<p>And Sawatari-san?</p>
<p>Has my PC been properly disposed of?</p>
<p>Some suspicions still remain. But, fretting over this won&#8217;t achieve anything at this point. I have to decide what to do next.</p>
<p>Actually, wait a moment.</p>
<p>The me right now, is anything happening to me? And by the way, that earlier sensation&#8230;</p>
<p>I once again directed my consciousness to myself.</p>
<p>*<em>Puyon. Puyon</em>*</p>
<p>My body moves with rhythmic motion.</p>
<p>In that pitch black darkness, I spent some time to figure out my appearance.</p>
<p>And&#8230;</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>What a discovery!</p>
<p>i used to be simply handsome, but now I have this sleek and sophisticated body style!</p>
<p>Bah, are you an idiot! Don&#8217;t accept it~!</p>
<p>From all that I have gathered about my body, only that description seems appropriate.</p>
<p>No no, you know, <em>that</em> description</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t hate it, right? Yeah. Some could even call it cute, after all.</p>
<p>But well&#8230;  If you were asked [Would you want to become one?], I&#8217;d say 90 percent of people would reply the same way.</p>
<p>However, all I can do is accept this situation.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>It seems that I have reincarnated as a slime.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>*Moshamosha*</p>
<p>*Moshamoshamosha*</p>
<p>I am eating grass.</p>
<p>Why? Isn&#8217;t it obvious?</p>
<p>I. HAVE. NOTHING. TO. DO!!!</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Since I have accepted, albeit grudgingly, the fact that I became a slime, a day has passed.</p>
<p>The first concern on my mind was, of course, food.</p>
<p>I first tried to see if this slime body can feel hunger. For that purpose, I first checked my surroundings and found a place where grass seemed to be abundant.</p>
<p>On that note, I need to point out that the first grass was right by my side. When needed, I could eat it, and it&#8217;s sap seems to be usable in its own way. Being stuck in this complete darkness, I am very lucky to have had it so close. Even basic motion could result in death, after all.</p>
<p>And so, let&#8217;s experiment.</p>
<p>After counting fifty thousand sheep, I got bored.</p>
<p>I tried to see if I would fall asleep, but don&#8217;t feel even a little bit tired.</p>
<p>I tried counting prime numbers, but didn&#8217;t know the next one, so I gave up.</p>
<p><em>Shiritori</em> by oneself is also pointless&#8230; is there a way to kill time by yourself?</p>
<p>(TL Note: Shiritori is a game where you take the last sound in a word and make the next word with it)</p>
<p>If there was Internet, I could waste my time away endlessly; cellphone games would also do. But this&#8230; this is torture.</p>
<p>Meditating like an ascetic monk is impossible for an amateur like I.</p>
<p>One thing I am still uncertain about: where any animals run around here.</p>
<p>There have been no signs of them until now.</p>
<p>Well, having no sight, hearing, or smell I can&#8217;t say there have been none close by until now, but I haven&#8217;t been attacked by one until now, at least.</p>
<p>Thanks to that, without fearing for my life, I am leisurely living.</p>
<p>That is the conclusion I reached after heroically suffering this (mental) agony.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I do not feel hunger. Nor do I need sleep.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Seriously, my stomach neither craved food nor did I ever desire sleep.</p>
<p>As to how many days had passed&#8211;I could not tell in this darkness.</p>
<p>Nor have I heard that strange voice again. If I had, I wouldn&#8217;t mind playing along now.</p>
<p>Thus, since I have nothing to do&#8230; I am eating grass.</p>
<p>Since I have no other way to kill time, I am quietly munching on some grass.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;ve accumulated and dissolved so much grass in my body that I can sense it.</p>
<p>If you asked what purpose that served, I would confidently respond: none.</p>
<p>I am just afraid that if I don&#8217;t do something, I&#8217;ll go crazy.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve gotten used to the routine around here. First [Absorb], then [Disassemble], end with [Store], and then repeat.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s where I found a point to investigate.</p>
<p>Lacking an appetite brings forth another question: what about excretion? Clearly food is unnecessary for this body, but what about excretion?</p>
<p>The answer was&#8230; it&#8217;s unnecessary!</p>
<p>I have yet to excrete anything after all this time.</p>
<p>Being a slime and all it is not unexpected for this things to be unnecessary, but, in that case, what is this [Store] thing all about?</p>
<p>From what I&#8217;ve noticed, I haven&#8217;t been changing in any way.</p>
<p>But in that case, what happens with what I eat?</p>
<p>＜＜Solution. It is stored in the stomach associated with unique skill [Predator]. At this moment, less than 1% is occupied＞＞</p>
<p>What? A responseーーー!</p>
<p>But, since when have I been using that skill? I&#8217;ve selected [NO], after all&#8230;</p>
<p>＜＜Solution. Unique skill [Predator] has not been activated. Substances entering into the body are automatically stored. This function is modifiable＞＞</p>
<p>Huh&#8230; The responses are much more smoother now. Not that it&#8217;s important.</p>
<p>About the skill, what will happen if I use it?</p>
<p>＜＜Solution. The effects of unique skill [Predator] are&#8230;</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Predation: To absorb the target into the body. However, if the target is conscious, the success rate greatly decreases.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">The affected targets include organic matter, inorganic matter, skills, and magic.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Analysis: The absorbed target is studied and analyzed. Craftable items can then be produced. Should many items gather, a duplicate can be produced. In the case of successful skill or magic analysis, the same technique can be acquired.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Stomach: The target can be stored. Items produced can also be stored. There is no storage time limit.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Mimicry: Replicate the target&#8217;s appearance. The skills and abilities used by the target can also be used. However, this depends on the successful analysis and acquisition of relative information regarding the target.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Isolation: Materials harmful or unnecessary for analysis can also be stored. They will be used to replace magic energy.</p>
<p>These five points are your power＞＞</p>
<p>Eh&#8230;? EH?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a while since I last trembled with excitement. Somehow, I just heard of some incredible power&#8230;Such an amazing ability has never been held by a slime before.</p>
<p>Wait, before that.</p>
<p>The voice that hears my questions, what is this? Is there someone there.</p>
<p>＜＜Solution. This is an effect of the unique skill [Great Sage]. For the sake of quickly utilizing your skills, a response function has been added＞＞</p>
<p>Great sage, huh&#8230; A title I thought was given out to spite me. To think it would be so reliable now. From now on, I&#8217;ll depend on it more.</p>
<p>That being said, this is a pretty good situation.</p>
<p>This could be the end to this isolation I thought eternal.</p>
<p>Perhaps this &#8220;Voice&#8221; is only an auditory hallucination I made myself. Well, that would be fine in its own way.</p>
<p>And thus, since a long time ago, my heart has felt at ease.</p>
<p>.</p>
