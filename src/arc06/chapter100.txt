<h3>Chapter 100 - Underground Labyrinth</h3>
<hr />
<p>After finishing the meeting with Fuze, I headed back to Tempest. <br />
I can move to any previously visited location via 『Spatial Travel』 you see. <br />
It does use up some magic energy, but my reserves are so vast that I don’t even feel it. <br />
So it’s a super useful skill that lets me transfer to places without any detriment. <br />
When I neared the city, Gerudo contacted me via telepathy. <br />
(We seek your immediate guidance, Rimuru-sama!) <br />
What could be wrong? <br />
With that thought, I transferred to Gerudo. <br />
In a leap completed in a single moment, I head towards Gerudo. It truly is a very useful skill. <br />
Not that I’m going to appear right by his side, rather I am going materialize in the near vicinity. <br />
If necessary, I could appear exactly on a desired spot, but this time let’s transfer a little further away. <br />
Well, in fact, since it’s a place I’ve visited before, I don’t actually need to focus on transferring to the individual. <br />
And at this point it’s easier to move towards him by foot. <br />
Gerudo was at the tunnel that Veldora had blown up. <br />
Pieces of demon steel were spread across the landscape barely obscuring the ruined tunnel. <br />
I had ordered it to be restored, yet no work seems to have been done. <br />
I wonder why? <br />
Gerudo seems to be arguing with somebody.</p>
<p>「I’m telling you~! We’re now occupying these tunnels!」 <br />
「Even if so you say, we have not recognized your claims. <br />
Please allow me to consult Rimuru-sama first.」 <br />
「No way! Can’t you see, we’ve abandoned the labyrinth?! <br />
Are you seriously planning on making us homeless?」 <br />
「No one is saying that. By the way, stop trying to sneak demon steel out of here.」 <br />
「Tch. How sharp! Don’t sweat the small things, or my Beretta will–Wha!!」</p>
<p>Erasing my presence, I successfully captured Ramiris. <br />
And looked her right in the face. <br />
No question about it, it’s Ramiris.</p>
<p>「What the hell are you doing?」 <br />
「Y-yahoo! What’s up, Rimuru?」</p>
<p>Averting her eyes, Ramiris greeted me. <br />
Even without asking, I know exactly what she was planning on doing. <br />
She’s planning on claiming the demon steel and connecting the tunnel into the labyrinth. <br />
She’s said something about building an entrance around here before, after all.</p>
<p>「So, you were planning on building a labyrinth here and you were discovered by Gerudo?」 <br />
「Eh… no, there’s now way… I think. Maybe…?」 <br />
「In other words, I’m right. Seriously…」 <br />
「Aha, ahahaha…..」</p>
<p>She tried laughing the matter off. <br />
Looking around, there’s a clear need to reclaim the resources and repair the land, I thought. <br />
But, maybe it’s a good idea to have her build the labyrinth here after all? <br />
I mean, think about my last conversation with Myormiles. <br />
We want people to continuously revisit Tempest. <br />
But, perhaps not every day, but at least every season. <br />
So, is there something we could do that would attract people that often? <br />
For example… how about we create a dungeon (labyrinth)? <br />
This might be a good idea. <br />
I look at Ramiris. Without a care, she’s just smiling at me. <br />
She’s a little… no, she’s very unreliable, but maybe she’ll manage. <br />
Steeling myself, I expressed my proposal.</p>
<p>＊　＊　＊</p>
<p>My proposal. <br />
It’s very simple, really. <br />
I’ll have Ramiris create a labyrinth and act as it’s manager. <br />
And we’ll thus have the labyrinth generate some profit. <br />
Ramiris will live there, and I’ll get some pocket change. <br />
Of course, this idea requires her complete support, but she doesn’t seem opposed to it? <br />
In fact, when I disclosed the plan,</p>
<p>「Eh, eh? In other words, I can make a labyrinth here?! <br />
…Actually… could this be a chance to finally dispel that horrid nickname: NEET?!」</p>
<p>Opening her eyes wide, she exclaimed. <br />
Well, I did think of it more as a joke though.</p>
<p>「U-umm… it is true that I can earn some money this way?」</p>
<p>Swallowing hard, she asked me with a serious expression. <br />
She’s probably afraid that I’ll change my mind. <br />
Though there’s no way I would. Well, not like all my promises are enforceable, though.</p>
<p>「I’m serious. But, I wouldn’t know how much profit we can make until we try it… <br />
Well, there will be related expenses, so how about 20% of the profits?」 <br />
「Umm… how much would that be?」 <br />
「Well, if a thousand adventurers visit in a single day, you’d be getting 2 gold coins.」 <br />
「Geh!! S-s-such a f-f-fortune?!」 <br />
「Well, actual earnings might be higher or lower than predicted. <br />
And since you need to build a place to live anyways, you don’t suffer as a result, right?」</p>
<p>She violently shook her head. <br />
In the first place, had she built the labyrinth anywhere she wanted, she would still have to maintain it. <br />
So there was nothing disagreeable about this.</p>
<p>She hugged me tightly out of joy. <br />
Since both parties seem satisfied, this will become another project that I will oversee. <br />
Adding Gerudo to our discussion, we polish out the details. <br />
First, we have overnight plans to lay a road from the city here. <br />
It’s a trip that wouldn’t even take half a day. <br />
We had chosen this place as it was on the outer perimeter of the city. <br />
About 10 km away, I’d like to say? Once the road is done, we also plan to build a stable nearby. <br />
We had wanted to lay rails to transport people and baggage from here. <br />
Since letting horses and magic beasts into the city would lead to new hygienic problems. <br />
Reclaiming the demon steel is necessary for that goal, but I can just prepare some more. <br />
Since it’s relatively close to the city, an inn here would unlikely bring many customers. <br />
So, we decided to build a motel instead. <br />
But if we will build a labyrinth here, then an inn would be in order. <br />
If they wanted to truly relax, they could always come back to Tempest. It’s a good idea to keep work housing and home separate. <br />
And if we build a labyrinth here we are bound to attract some adventurers. <br />
It might be a good idea to also service the carriages coming to and from the Dwarf Kingdom and the (ex)Farmas Kingdom. <br />
Drawing up the plan, I have Gerudo confirm it. <br />
He finds it acceptable. <br />
Moreover, the site of our battle with the knights is only a few steps away. <br />
Two kilometers towards the city, where a number of roads intersect, is the planned site of the arena. <br />
It’s relatively close to the city, so we expect the guests to walk there. <br />
Unlike our world, people tend to walk here. <br />
It’s unimaginable to not walk a round trip of less than 20 km. They also follow the early to bed, early to rise policy. <br />
So if we hold the tournament from 10:00~15:00, that should give them enough time to make the trip. <br />
As for the staff, we can probably have them stay at the inn. <br />
Having thus agreed with Gerudo, we moved on to discussing the arena blueprint. <br />
After talking to Myormiles, I finally envisioned how I wanted it to look. <br />
Normally, I would spend hours in front of my laptop creating the plan, but now I can do it by hand. <br />
Raphael really is useful at these minor things. <br />
Accepting my design with a “No problem”, Gerudo left. <br />
When I looked at Ramiris,</p>
<p>「Uhehe… now even I will be making money, huh. <br />
Gone are the days when I was made fun of as the Poverty Demon Lord!」</p>
<p>Is she tripping? She seems completely lost in her world. <br />
Well, I guess she’ll be fine. <br />
She’s been significantly ridiculed up until now. <br />
Though who has heard of a demon lord in want of money? <br />
(TL Note: “in want of” means to lack) <br />
Though more than money, not working is the problem I believe… <br />
True, Ramiris’ Labyrinth was rather devoid of… people. <br />
She was probably really bored and really lonely. <br />
I really hope adventurers show up. For Ramiris’ and my sake. <br />
Dragging Ramiris back into reality, we go over the detail of the labyrinth. <br />
Ramiris is showing a determined face, the likes that I never have seen from her before, and is ready to go. <br />
I had five questions for her.</p>
<ol>
<li>How many floors can be constructed underground?</li>
<li>How many days would it take to finish?</li>
<li>What about the monsters inside?</li>
<li>Can interior layout be altered? Further, can treasure chests be set up?</li>
<li>In case of death, could we set up a system where they are reborn on the surface?</li>
</ol>
<p>Is what I asked. <br />
Here’s what she answered.</p>
<ol>
<li>There’s no limit, but realistically, at most 100 floors.</li>
<li>It’s possible to finish in a day. Thanks to species-skill 『Labyrinth Creation』 it can be created in a single moment. The interior aside.</li>
<li>Whatever we wish since Spirits inhabited the previous one, they did not spawn. But, if magic concentration falls, only weak monsters will spawn.</li>
<li>It’s possible. Actually, customizing the interior is one of the functions of her skills. It’s also possible to create a rotation of floor patterns, but only one floor at a time. If not the structure but the interior–that can be changed relatively simply.</li>
<li>It’s possible. But, you would have to wear a special item created via 『Labyrinth Creation』</li>
</ol>
<p>Is what she said</p>
<p>「Wonderful! It’s wonderful, Ramiris-kun!」 <br />
「Really, like really really? Am I really amazing?」 <br />
「Yeah. Now our ambitions have overlapped!」 <br />
「Really? I was just thinking the same thing」</p>
<p>We nodded at each other.</p>
<p>「I’m looking forward to working with you, Ramiris」 <br />
「Yeah, I’ll be in your care. Joining a large organization is like riding a big ship. It’s reassuring」</p>
<p>Big ship, huh. Let’s hope we’re not the Titanic. <br />
Since our sizes are different, we couldn’t really shake hands but we were one in spirit. <br />
I decided to have Ramiris take the demon steel scattered around. <br />
Since it seems that she will make something really useful. <br />
We continued to exchange ideas regarding the design and concept of the dungeon. <br />
While being very merry. <br />
Me and Ramiris “being merry” and discussing the dungeon. <br />
To say the least, our conversation went into a weird direction and we drafted out a design of a super advanced dungeon. <br />
Next is production. <br />
As Ramiris declared, it will easily be done by tomorrow. <br />
So promising to come visit, I return to the city. <br />
I need to have Kurobee hand over all those test armors and weapons that won’t be seeing the marketplace any time soon.</p>
<p>「Is this fine, Rimuru-sama? These articles are imperfect and can hardly be used by the average person.」 <br />
「Nah, it’s fine. I’ll leave these aside to receive the spirit’s blessing and have them soak up some magic energy. <br />
They might become magic items, you see.」 <br />
「Is that so. In that case, do as you see fit.」</p>
<p>He said and took out the products from the cellar. <br />
I accepted them and expressed my thanks. <br />
However, to think that he had so many trial products. <br />
At some point, he had added a hundred items to this list. There are full sets here as well, and all of these items are far better than what you would find being sold in a store. <br />
But, as Kurobee mentioned, these are imperfect items to which the user could never adjust to. <br />
So these can hardly be called tools. <br />
But in exchange for sucking up magical energy and converting it into raw strength, the user can temporarily obtain unbelievable physical power. <br />
Well, it’s not like you should only use it if you have a death wish, but only a fool would use an untested product. <br />
Not that I’d take responsibility for that, though. <br />
So what should I do about this product line? <br />
I’m actually playing on putting it into treasure chests inside the dungeon and having special monsters guard these. <br />
To think I would have a chance at a real life dungeon creator… this is too exciting. <br />
Well, it is true that just auctioning these products off would bring a lot of gold. <br />
Actually, that might be the best option. <br />
But, that’s no good. What’s most important is the ongoing advertisement of Tempest. <br />
If they see the beauty of our city and feel it’s charm, surely they will come again. <br />
Honestly, when I told Ramiris that she can create an entrance to her labyrinth, I originally intended it to be in the middle of the city. <br />
But, I soon realized the benefit of having a tavern town for adventurer’s convenience. <br />
Equipment and the like should be bought up in the city. <br />
Just think about how much money will be spent. Even if we stock up ahead of time, we’ll probably run out. <br />
With the money left over for maintenance and purchase of raw material, we can probably offer sales for return customers. <br />
That way, the adventurers will speak of us among themselves and Tempest will certainly gain fame. <br />
Moreover, it’s probably a good idea to keep the citizens busy. <br />
The Tournament will probably be held at most twice a year, but we’ll certainly hold other events. <br />
Military drills, adventurer tests. <br />
So we’ll definitely put all these buildings to use. And the dungeon will certainly draw even more attention. <br />
Thus, having assembled all these parts, I have finally decided to gain the one being necessary to make it all work out. <br />
Veldora. <br />
Veldora’s in my room. <br />
He’s grown very accustomed to it.</p>
<p>「Hey, Veldora, I’ve got a favor to ask of you.」 <br />
「Hmm? Can’t you see that I’m busy?」</p>
<p>Yeah. You’re reading manga. <br />
And clearly have nothing to do.</p>
<p>「I see… that’s too bad. And, I was just about to offer something fun to do. <br />
If you’re busy, it can’t be helped. I guess I’ll just ask Diablo.」</p>
<p>I said, and pretended to leave</p>
<p>「Hey, wait up. I’m busy, but I’ll listen to <em>your</em> request. <br />
Speak!」</p>
<p>Hook, line, and sinker. <br />
How easy to manipulate he is. <br />
It’s as easy to manipulate this old geezer as taking a candy from a baby. <br />
But that aside,</p>
<p>「The thing is, we were thinking about building a dwelling for you. <br />
Ramiris and I were talking about it, and she’s currently building it.」 <br />
「W-what did you say?! Seriously? <br />
But, why did you call it a favor?」</p>
<p>Whether he’s deeply interested or not, he has a serious look on his face. <br />
Seriously… too easy. <br />
I told Veldora about the Dungeon plan.</p>
<p>「So the thing is, we need a king to rule over the dungeon. <br />
Ramiris will supervise it. And, on the 100th floor we’ll create an entrance leading to the spirits’ labyrinth. <br />
We need a strongest guardian to protect this gate.」 <br />
「I see… and you want me to do it?」 <br />
「Exactly. And while in the labyrinth, I want you to constantly flaunt your aura.」 <br />
「Seriously? It’s okay?」 <br />
「It is.」</p>
<p>I nodded. <br />
Frankly, I don’t care at all about the guardian. <br />
What I want is Veldora’s aura. <br />
If he releases it around here, it will so densely concentrate, that normal people won’t be able to survive. <br />
But if he keeps it in too long, releasing it will create an explosion like last time. <br />
So it’s probably not a good idea to keep it in that long. So there’s a need to release it. <br />
Which means, that we needed to find a place for him to do so… <br />
The cave of the seal could not completely restrain all of Veldora’s aura. <br />
That’s why I had the dungeon be made 100 floors deep and once he freely release his aura. <br />
And it’s true purpose… <br />
Once the magic concentration increases, monsters will naturally spawn. <br />
As it trickles upwards, the upper floors will certainly be occupied by small fry with strong beings further in. <br />
Even the cave had A- ranked Tempest Serpents spawn. <br />
Just what kind of monster will he spawn now, I can’t even begin to imagine it. <br />
Perhaps another intelligent slime will spawn among them. <br />
So Veldora releasing his aura will only benefit us. <br />
Killing two birds with one stone, essentially.</p>
<p>「… And when I see adventurers, <br />
『Kuahahaha, you have done well coming this far! Let me welcome you, insects!』 <br />
or something like, <br />
『Kuahahaha, you can’t run away from me. Didn’t you know? You can’t run away from the Storm Dragon!』 <br />
And fight them, right?」</p>
<p>Veldora said. <br />
He’s completely into it by now. He didn’t seem to into it in the beginning, though. <br />
I nodded,</p>
<p>「Moreover, it would also be possible to face entire units of adventurers. <br />
It’s like, a Real Simulation Game, you see. <br />
How about it? Doesn’t it sound fun?」</p>
<p>Veldora stood up, and put the manga in his pocket. <br />
And facing me,</p>
<p>「As expected of you, Rimuru. I always knew you could do great things.」</p>
<p>He said, and shook my hand. <br />
Thank god he’s an idiot. <br />
And thus, I have (with great difficulty?) recruited Veldora.</p>
<p>The next day. <br />
Veldora and I went to see Ramiris. <br />
As she promised, the labyrinth was completed.</p>
<p>「Yo, Ramiris, you doing good?」 <br />
「Ah, master! It has been a while. I am in perfect health!」</p>
<p>These two are friendly as always. <br />
Ramiris was already sitting on Veldora’s shoulder by the time they began the exchange. <br />
And after exchanging greetings, we got right into the explanation. <br />
As I had wanted, the labyrinth was created via a number of blocks. <br />
That was, once every few days we can change its layout. <br />
Every ten floors we have set up save points. <br />
Upon reaching this point, the next time you enter you can continue from where you left off. <br />
To that end, we had decided to grant licenses to adventurers to use magic teleportation circles. <br />
Selling maps is probably too evil. It’ll also be a pain to make new ones every day. <br />
And let’s not forget about the most important item. <br />
The charm made by Ramiris’『Labyrinth Creation』 <br />
It will only work once. <br />
Any death that occurred in the labyrinth will be negated, and the user will be returned to the surface. <br />
It will activate ten seconds after death has been confirmed. <br />
There’s also an emergency escape item that returns the user to the surface. <br />
These safeguards we plan to sell at the entrance. Whether they buy these or not is their choice. <br />
But if you don’t but it and die… you only have yourself to blame. <br />
I, personally, would definitely buy it. <br />
As for the price, we can decided that later. For now, all done.</p>
<p>Hopefully this will all end as well as we want it to. <br />
There are still many things left to implement, but that’s for later. <br />
We exchanged glances, and laughed like the villains we are.</p>
