<h3>Chapter 98 - Letter of Invitation</h3>
<hr />
<p>Templars, defeated!</p>
<p>Every country bordering the Jura Forest soon heard these news. <br />
It was preposterous to think that they could have secretly invaded without being seen. <br />
Moreover, countries that had relations with Tempest could hardly believe that their intelligence gathering teams were negligent. <br />
Of course, Rimuru was aware that these countries were sending spies. <br />
Which is why he had ordered a victory that produced the fewest casualties. <br />
And country executives realized this fact. <br />
After all, the fact that none of the knights were killed only proved their hypotheses.</p>
<p>For example, in the Dwarf Kingdom–military nation Dwargon. <br />
The ministers gathered upon the Dwarf King’s request. <br />
They were analyzing a recorded image, while scrutinizing every bit of data they could acquire. With every minister having access to the said information. <br />
The data they had acquired disclosed the matters of the battle. <br />
The results were rather surprising. <br />
One hundred Knights Templar, believed to be the strongest among humans, planned an invasion of the country. <br />
However, Demon Lord Rimuru had intercepted this plan, and his response left the knights completely defeated. <br />
How truly terrifying the Demon Lord Rimuru’s information gathering skills are! <br />
Certainly no less terrifying than his ability to strategize! <br />
So murmured the Ministers. <br />
However, was it as they said? The Dwarf King looked over the data, and his sight fell upon a bizarre pattern of movements displayed by the combatants. <br />
Was this not supposed to devolve into a haphazard encounter between the forces? <br />
Such a thought came to his mind. Actually, that’s the only possibility he could have imagined. <br />
No matter how much anyone claimed that the altered terrain caused the knights to dance in the palm of Rimuru’s hand, it should have had no bearing on the actual combat. <br />
If so, he was actually constantly staying aware of Hinata’s plans while modifying the strategy to sway the battle in his favor. <br />
And as a result, by controlling every aspect of the battle, the knights were completely defeated. <br />
Unfortunately, since the recording magic is rather limited, the dwarfs could only lament the lack of a comprehensive report. <br />
That is, it could only produce a soundless spectacle of the battlefield. <br />
Nor could it analyze the skills used; at most, it helped identify the winner. <br />
Even so, the data they gathered is certainly of grave importance. <br />
Thus he scrutinized it again. <br />
Captain-class knights were seen moving in various directions with some plan in mind. The Tempest department heads intercepted resulting in combat. <br />
The result was a total war across all fronts and a complete victory for Tempest. <br />
Among these battles, it was noted that a single monster could overwhelm eight knights–much to the dwarfs’ surprise. <br />
Considering that these knights were at least of captain class, it is best to assume that Monster Country Tempest easily surpasses the military might of Dwargon. <br />
The ministers noisily grumbled about this, while King Gazelle Dwargo sighed in relief. <br />
He was truly glad that Demon Lord Rimuru was an idealistic monster who sought friendship with the humans. <br />
Had he been a monster who sought to destroy humanity, humans would have faced an unprecedented calamity. <br />
(Besides, he’s growing too fast!) <br />
Was Gazelle’s true thoughts. <br />
He had thought Rimuru to be full of potential when they had first met, but he had never considered that he could progress this far. <br />
Should he have destroyed him then? He could not come up with an answer. <br />
For better or worse, this demon lord was interesting. <br />
And, they currently have a cooperation pact and will be proceeding on friendly terms in the future. <br />
Moreover, thanks to his “World Traveler” ideals, he has been developing some interesting contraptions. <br />
Sparing no time nor effort, and aligning himself with no other “World Traveler”, perhaps such is the true strength of this demon lord. <br />
His movements have thus produced some interesting results. <br />
And the many skills and technologies developed thus the dwarfs are able to obtain without lifting a finger. <br />
So Gazelle decided. <br />
Even if the angels destroy him, the dwarfs will not allow the technology to be lost. <br />
Of course, they will probably become more and more militaristic in the future… but Oh well! <br />
How much joy the dwarfs felt from all the inventions that came from that country. <br />
(At this point, we have no choice but to trust Demon Lord Rimuru!) <br />
Besides, he had released all the knights unharmed this time. <br />
This could be interpreted as seeking to coexist with the humans. <br />
Had he intended to fight them, he could have massacred the knights. After all, who can complain that an invading force was destroyed? <br />
And yet he had let them live. Completely unharmed. <br />
This could also be interpreted to mean that he had the confidence that Knight Templar class soldiers are of no threat to him. <br />
This is causing quite a division among the ministers: some calling him a danger, others rejecting that notion. <br />
Both are probably correct. <br />
But there’s only one decision. <br />
Gazelle cleared his throat and thus got everyone’s attention. <br />
The conference room was completely silent, with every gaze focused on the king.</p>
<p>「That demon lord seeks to coexist with humans, so, as much as possible, we will support him. That is the official position of military nation Dwargon!」</p>
<p>The dwarf king’s declaration reverberated through the hall. <br />
The ministers bowed their heads and accepted their lord’s will. <br />
Thus the policy was decided. The specific measures would now be drafted by excellent individuals. <br />
Whether this was a right or wrong decision, he could not have known. <br />
But, the Dwarf King had no regrets.</p>
<p>And then another report was brought to the king.</p>
<p>「Your Majesty, Rigurdo-dono has sent an announcement. <br />
It seems that they are planning on holding an event to make known the ascension of a new demon lord and seek our presence. <br />
Well, this might be a political farce, however. They are simply trying to appeal to countries they are friendly with. <br />
Doesn’t seem like they actually expect our presence, so how should we respond?」 <br />
「Oh, about that! Bester also mentioned something! <br />
Tempest, it seems, is planning on holding a tournament… <br />
Probably a show to go along with the announcement.」 <br />
「What will we do? If we plan to attend, they have requested that we notify them in advance. <br />
Speaking of, <br />
There is limited number of seats, and the city is bound to be crowded that day, so they have asked to promptly answer them.」</p>
<p>Bester’s question was brought up along with this report. <br />
The Dwarf King pondered for a second. <br />
(Actually, what the hell is that stupid demon lord planning hosting a tournament now of all time…) <br />
Completely unpredictable. <br />
Hence amusing. <br />
The Dwarf King struggled to keep a smile from surfacing. <br />
He could not break his facade before the ministers. <br />
(You bastard… making me suffer so… I like it!) <br />
Stifling the joy with a hint of anger, he announced his decision.</p>
<p>「We will attend the ceremony and the tournament」</p>
<p>He said. <br />
The Ministers had not at all expected such a response, but this was the decision of their king. <br />
With the meeting decided, they quickly started to prepare for the journey.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">＊　＊　＊</p>
<p>Sorcerer Dynasty Sarion, the Emperor’s Castle. <br />
A beautiful garden full of rare life spread behind it. <br />
Keeping up the garden provided numerous benefits for the dynasty to say nothing of income made from it. <br />
In other words, it was the source of the dynasty’s pocket money. <br />
The entire garden was maintained without a penny from the taxes. <br />
Two beings relaxed inside this garden. <br />
One was Duke Elalude. <br />
Father of Adventurer Ellen, and one of the three leaders of this country. <br />
And a being who was sitting across from him. <br />
This being is the only one with a higher standing than Duke Elalude in the entire kingdom. <br />
Empress Elumeshia Elure Sarion herself. <br />
With a beautiful feminine face–well, she is a woman, after all–she has elf blood flowing through her veins and thus doesn’t age. <br />
Asking the empress how old she is, is considered a taboo. <br />
She has the body of a girl who has just reached adulthood. With skin as white as fresh snow. <br />
Long pointed ears easily distinguish her from anyone else. The glance of her slanted, jade eyes pierce into the very soul of the person before her. <br />
And, long pale blue silver hair falls gently over her cheeks. <br />
Duke Elalude was once entranced by the beauty she embodied, but was able to regain his mind after considering his wife’s and daughter’s wrath. <br />
And with a short prayer, he faced the Empress. <br />
The one so gracefully sitting upon the cushion across from him,</p>
<p>「Your Majesty, regarding the monster country I have reported on previously, we have received an announcement.」</p>
<p>He said and taking out a letter from his breast pocket handed it to the Empress. <br />
He checked that it was safe. As for its contents, he would rather not say them himself. <br />
He knew all to well that the Empress hated to have people learn things before her. <br />
But… <br />
(Having become a demon lord is great and all, but why announce it?) <br />
And here is the question. <br />
The letter was addressed to Duke Elalude. Normally, there was no need to let the Empress know about it. <br />
But… it read “Please let us know how many people will participate!” <br />
And that means that any number of guests are invited. <br />
So if he doesn’t let the Empress know and goes by himself, she’ll just get mad at him again. And he would rather that not happen. <br />
After all… <br />
When he left on a mission to free his daughter from the clutches of an evil demon lord, he received a stern scolding. <br />
Here’s what she said.</p>
<p>「You bastard, how dare you leave your lord’s side! I can’t believe that such an interesting slime exists until I see it personally. Moreover, to witness a birth of a demon lord, which even I have never seen? I’m so jeal… Ummm, it’s ridiculous! To have missed such a wonderf… I mean, you don’t even know the danger you were facing! What a fool!」</p>
<p>And she became depressed. <br />
Oh, and only Elalude ever saw Empress act like this. <br />
She appears as a cold hearted individual to the other ministers, and is even feared as the Doll Empress. <br />
Like a sheep in wolf’s clothing! Elalude always wants to retort. <br />
So he perfectly understood how angry she would have been had he gone off by himself this time. <br />
Moreover. <br />
They even claimed to conduct a Tournament at this occasion. <br />
If he left her behind, her anger would be unimaginable. <br />
Currently, due to her sulking, he has yet to establish technological cooperation with that country. <br />
So if her mood improves, maybe they’ll finally be able to finalize those details. <br />
There’s another important point. <br />
He had confirmed that Tempest had fought against the Templars recently. <br />
He had worried about how they will fare against them, but, surprisingly, they didn’t just completely defeat them all, they also released every knight. <br />
Basically claiming to have overwhelming confidence in themselves. <br />
They could perhaps be countries that try to appear weak with only the leaders aware of the true strength. <br />
But even so, to hold a tournament now of all times can only be interpreted as an event to flaunt their strength. <br />
Well, since this allows Sarion to measure their strength, it is crucial that they participate. <br />
But to bring the Empress to such an event would create a myriad problems… <br />
And he was certain that he himself would have to solve all of them. <br />
Empress Elumeshia returned the letter. <br />
Elalude gulped in anticipation.</p>
<p>「Your Majesty, how shall we respond?」</p>
<p>He hesitantly asked. <br />
With a wide smile on her face,</p>
<p>「How indeed…」</p>
<p>She was just putting on airs. <br />
He could easily predict her next words but still waited for them. <br />
And hearing an expected response, Duke Elalude would spend the next days without any sleep, busy with preparations.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">＊　＊　＊</p>
<p>In the small country Brumund’s trading house, Myormiles was getting tired of the person talking to him. <br />
As a merchant, he could tell a person’s personality with a single glance. <br />
Those coming for money, those coming with a new business opportunity. <br />
There’s also fallen nobles who come proposing dubious deals. <br />
Among all these fools there maybe someone with a legitimate proposal. <br />
So he can’t leave this job to anyone else. <br />
While thinking this, he dismissed the swindler before him and called forth the new guest. <br />
A handsome man entered. <br />
But Myormiles would not be deceived. <br />
This man too was a fallen noble who had once tried to sell some junk at high price using his name. <br />
He probably came with another idea and is seeking money. <br />
But, if anything, he is a noble. Myormiles verified this himself. <br />
So rudeness towards a true noble could be fatal. Which makes this job all the harder. <br />
“Another stupid idea is it,” he thought, and inquired the guest. <br />
And he was right. <br />
It really was rubbish. <br />
In short, I’ll open a new store using my slaves, so give me money! He said. <br />
Frankly, he can’t see this idea succeeding. A store needs a lot more than cute girls to be successful. <br />
Research the market and the buyers, consider the location, and pay for the girls’ children. <br />
Just because they are slaves does not mean they will work for free–they need food and shelter after all. There’s also initial costs to consider. <br />
Opening a brothel also requires one to consider the chance for disease to spread. <br />
If it does, not only the noble, but Myormiles himself would be indicted. <br />
So this is not something he could accept.</p>
<p>「My, what a discerning eye you have, Kazak-sama. <br />
But, regarding these female slaves, that would prove impossible, wouldn’t it. <br />
Human slave trade has been forbidden and opening a store with illegal slaves would be…」 <br />
「Oh, about that… here’s the thing. All is solved when a noble pays the right people some money. <br />
So, you know? Oh and this is a secret… but those slaves are elves」</p>
<p>He said in a haughty manner. <br />
Myormiles got a heartburn just listening to Count Kazak, but stifled his displeasure. <br />
As a merchant, he can’t show a customer displeasure. Even a novice merchant knows that. <br />
So how should he refuse him… <br />
And the moment he began to say something,</p>
<p>「Yo! How have you been, Myormiles-kun!」</p>
<p>The door burst open and in walked a person while greeting him. <br />
A beautiful girl (boy?) with silver hair, golden eyes walked in. <br />
Who can’t possible be here…</p>
<p>「Eh? Could it be, Rimuru-danna?」</p>
<p>A profoundly surprised voice escaped his lips. <br />
Huh? Didn’t Rimuru-dana become a demon lord? So Fuze-sama had said… <br />
And he is not wearing a mask? So he was this cute without it?! <br />
These thoughts filling his head, he had completely forgot about Count Kazak. <br />
And then he heard,</p>
<p>「Please wait! Master is currently with a guest!」</p>
<p>A panicking attendant attempted to stop him. <br />
Chances are, he had missed Rimuru coming in and was too late in stopping him. <br />
What a failure. But chances are, he wouldn’t have been able to stop him anyways. <br />
So Myormiles could hardly get angry at the attendant.</p>
<p>「Ah, sorry. You were with a guest, huh. Well then, I’ll wait in your store!」</p>
<p>And flashing an insincere smile, Rimuru added『Pardon my rudeness… nah, my bad!』 <br />
And leaving everyone dumbfounded he left. <br />
Afterwards, Myormiles ended the discussion with Count Kazak, and cleared his schedule for the rest of the day. <br />
A great wave was beginning to move the world. <br />
What was more important? <br />
Myormiles was not a fool who could not understand that much. <br />
He was certainly a person who could find ore within a stone. <br />
But! There was something he could create even if he were to abandon everything. <br />
A short acquaintanceship but large profit? That didn’t matter. <br />
Most important was his obligation to consider the long term benefit of his business partners–fellow merchants. <br />
He had intended to visit himself when things calmed down. <br />
That is, he has heard that after becoming a demon lord Rimuru has gone off to attend Walpurgis Banquet. <br />
So he could hardly take any action until he was sure of the changes. <br />
And yet the person himself had visited as if nothing had changed. <br />
So meeting with this person was by far the most important thing he had to do.</p>
<p>Remembering every strategy he knows, and hiding the pure joy that was filling his heart, Myormiles rushed to his store. <br />
What wicked plan would he propose today? <br />
And thus, Myormiles tedious days would come to an end.</p>
